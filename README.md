# Red Wine Analysis with R
<h3> Chemical Properties </h3>
<ul>
<li>fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily) (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)</li>
<li>volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste (acetic acid - g / dm^3)</li>
<li>citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines (g / dm^3)</li>
<li>residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops (g / dm^3)</li>
<li>chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine (sodium chloride - g / dm^3</li>
<li>free sulfur dioxide: he free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion (mg / dm^3)</li>
<li>total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02 (mg / dm^3)</li>
<li>density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content (g / cm^3)</li>
<li>pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic)</li>
<li>sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels (potassium sulphate - g / dm3)</li>
<li>alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine (% by volume)</li>
</ul>
<h5>Output variable (based on sensory data):</h5>
<ul>
<li>quality (score between 0 and 10)</li>
</ul>
